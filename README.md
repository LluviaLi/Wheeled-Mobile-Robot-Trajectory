## Abstract

More and more researchers have carried out deep study on wheeled mobile robots because of their wide range of application value. Having a complex environment and being vulnerable to external interference and control constraints, it is difficult to track the trajectory. To solve this problem, linear
and nonlinear MPC controller are introduced by using the tool Yalmip and CasADi. Then different constraints, weighting matrices and prediction horizon are used to study the system performance. In addition, disturbance are also considered. Finally a comparison between both controller are drawn.
